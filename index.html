            <h1>Dream Big</h1>
            <h3>Become a Product Designer at the top level</h3>
            <p>I have already designed many products for my own page and designed many more for some small business
                holders. But due to having studies and also a small baby I couldn't concentrate on my design that much.
                I need to study a lot and one day insa-allah I will become a top Designer.</p>

                <h3>From 2017 to now</h3>
                <p>I have workded in several pages as an owner. I had several partners in my shops.So I had some
                    responsibility to look after. So I mostly looked after the product design part. I started my journey
                    with the page <b>ONISH</b> to design several new dresses for women. There were Western dresses along
                    with desi Sari also. I designed many deshi juwelry for the page <b>Balika</b> also</p>

                <h3>From 2017 to now</h3>
                <p> Management capability that is something I am very fortunate to have. I had to manage different level
                    customers as well as differt type vendors to manage my business. I also had the opportunity to work
                    with
                    the foreign vendors. So managing all of the stakeholders are quite a challenge and I was always up
                    for
                    that. We had many investers in our business and I always make sure to keep them updated and happy
                    with
                    our service and policy.</p>
